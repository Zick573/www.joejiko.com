My name is Joe Jiko. I’m a web developer and graphic designer living in Florida. I specialize in solving problems and creating beautiful, accessible, user friendly websites and applications that work. I’ve designed, owned, and maintained websites since 2002! All of my code is enthusiastically hand written and delicately planned from start to finish.

I pay attention to things like Google, Facebook, Twitter, Apple, jQuery.
