"Joe Jiko" is a web developer, graphic designer, IT professional, and technology geek located in St. Petersburg near Tampa, Florida.

Less seriously, I like a lot of other things too.

This website was designed, written, and developed by Joe Jiko (me) for the latest version of [Mozilla Firefox](http://jiko.us/181Eror) (not tested in other browsers but it will probably work fine in [Google Chrome](http://jiko.us/13GLaNA) too). If you're using an inferior web browser, you can go view a screenshot of what you should/could be seeing.

If you don't know what a [web browser](http://jiko.us/10kcGTT) is, please get off the Internet. Shut down your computer until you find out or [consult Google](http://jiko.us/167407z). DO NOT call your "IT guy" about it.
