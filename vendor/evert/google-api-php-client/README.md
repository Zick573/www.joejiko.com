Google APIs Client Library for PHP
=====================================

## Important note

I've never completed this, and have no interest in further maintaining it.
Please don't start anything new based on this. I'm keeping this repository around for the people who may still need it.

## Description
The Google API Client Library enables you to work with Google APIs such as Buzz, Moderator, Tasks, or Latitude on your server.

This is a forked version from:
* http://code.google.com/p/google-api-php-client/

Current version is hosted here:
* https://github.com/evert/google-api-php-client

## Fork information

This project was forked to modernize the google api codebase a little bit.
The following changes have been made:

* Gotted rid of all require() statements. An autoloader is now required
* Renamed all classes. Everything is now in a GoogleApi namespace.
* Added composer package information (todo)
* Gotted rid of automatically executing code.

The existing documentation applies, just keep in mind that instead of class
like `apiHttpRequest`, you must now use `\GoogleApi\Io\HttpRequest`.



## Requirements:

* PHP 5.3.x or higher (http://www.php.net/)
* PHP Curl extension (http://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.curl.php)
* PHP JSON extension (http://php.net/manual/en/book.json.php)
