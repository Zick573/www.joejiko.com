<h2>Notes</h2>
<article id="noteswrap">
  <p>**known issues: <br>- the first/last buttons don't work right yet <br> -doesn't work on mobile</p>
  <p><del>NOTE: there's no loading animation.. but REST assured, it is loading. (haha that's a pun guys)</del></p>
  <p>TO DO: <br />
    - create note storage CRUD<br />
    <del>-need to make it auto check for new updates (3-15 minutes probably. depends on how gay the last.fm API limiting is)</del><br>
    -cache results to DB<br />
    
    -permalink for each entry (pull from database<br />
    
    -add "like" button next to track<br />
    
    -create variable urls like joejiko.com/music/-artist-/-track- that will load information about the song playing (possibly from google or another service) *spotify<br />
    
    <del>-scroll to the top of the list after user changes pages (or page refreshes)</del><br />
    
    -display a popup with spotify search results
    OR -if more than 1 result, filter by artist<br />
    
    - check authorized user list to see who's currently listening<br />
    
    - use tabs for users instead of drop down<br />
    
    - type in a last.fm username<br />
    
    - fix spinner so that it stays in the wrapper
  </p>
  <p>* Any suggestions you have would be great!</p>
