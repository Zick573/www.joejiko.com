    <p>Regarding content posted to this site: I don't believe in privacy. The best way to be sure something is private is to NEVER POST IT in the first place.</p>
    <p>That being said, I will NEVER (ever) share your data with anyone or email you without permission.</p>
    <p>All precautions have been taken to ensure that all stored data is not accessible.</p>
    <p>I don't store user passwords or payment information of any kind.</p>
    <p>If you see something of yours on my site that you want taken off (or proper attribution applied), please <a href="/contact">contact me</a> immediately.</p>
    <p>That's all. Thanks for visiting!</p>
