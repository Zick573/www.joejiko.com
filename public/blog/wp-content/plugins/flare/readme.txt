Flare is a simple yet eye-catching social sharing bar that gets you followed and lets your content get shared via posts, pages, and media types.

== Description ==

Up your website's social score with a little social Flare! Easily configure and share your blog posts across some of the most popular networks.

Flare allows you to:

* *NEW!* Follow Me widget - place widgets on your site with links to your social networks to get more followers.
* Configure multiple share icons for some of the most popular sharing services like Twitter, Facebook, Stumble Upon, Reddit, Google+ and Pinterest! More coming soon!
* Easily order your icons, customize their icons' appearance
* Control which post types your Flare appears on
* Display your Flare at the top, bottom, left or right sides of your post content
* Flare displayed on the left and right of your post follow your visitors down the page as they scroll and conveniently hide when not needed

Flare buttons work in IE7+ as well as current versions of Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Opera; vertical following does not work in IE6. Admin interface requires a modern browser (e.g. anything not IE 6-8 :). Utilizes jQuery for JavaScript processing, although it is setup to work properly with other libraries, your experience may vary. Requires PHP 5.2+.

This plugin is free to use and is not actively supported by the author, but will be monitored for serious bugs that may need correcting.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can you make the share widgets of Flare deployable via a shortcode? = 
Not really unfortunately. The Flare JavaScript to make the floating bar appear requires the presence of multiple elements on the page in different locations, so deploying via a shortcode doesn't really work.

= Can I place the Flare "Follow Me" widget non widget areas of my theme? =
You sure can! Just use the [the_widget()](http://codex.wordpress.org/the_widget "WordPress Codex Documentation: the_widget()") function to deploy the *FlareFollowWidget* widget in your template files. For example:

`<?php the_widget( 'FlareFollowWidget', array( 'title' => "Follow Me", 'iconstyle' => "round", 'iconsize' => 64, 'iconspacing' => 5 ) ); ?>`

The widget takes four "instance" parameters:

* `title` - The title of the widget area
* `iconstyle` - The style of the icon. This can be any of the keys found in the `Flare->iconstyles` array in the main `flare.php` file
* `iconsize` - The size of the icon in pixels as an integer (ex. `64` for 64 pixels)
* `iconspacing` - The spacing between the icons in pixels as an integer (ex. `10` for 10 pixels)

= My Reddit count is wrong =
Reddit fuzzes their count, so every time a count total is requested or displayed in the widget, its going to be a little different (usually +/- 20). This issue is on Reddit, so unfortunately we can't really do anything about it :(

= My Flare widgets are in a wierd position on my page =
When it all boils down to it, Flare is just HTML and CSS. We try to place the Flare widgets in a location that is as un-obtrusive as possible and works in as many layouts as possible. As there are an infinite variety of themes out there though, your website's theme might not work well with where we attempt to place Flare. The good news is, you can fix this by writing some CSS in your theme's style.css file. Use a browser inspector such as Firebug for Firefox or the developer tools for Chrome and Safari to find out what styles need modifying for your Flare layout and write some overrides in your theme's style.css file.

= My content is not in English and the social widgets are flowing outside the bubble Flare gives it =
Unfortunately we cannot check the size of the content inside the social widgets themselves as they are in IFRAME tags. We set the IFRAME tag dimensions to work pretty well for most situations, but sometimes, they need to be wider. As mentioned in the previous FAQ though, you can always write a line or two of CSS in your theme's style.css file to change the width of the bubbles.
