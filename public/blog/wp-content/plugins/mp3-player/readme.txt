in your post and an mp3 player will be rendered. 
From version 0.9 the plugin supports html5, so you can use the player for iphones

Give it the attribute sc="your-playlis-set" [mp3 sc="your-playlist-set"]
Your playlist set has an unike name
for example this is one of my sets http://soundcloud.com/simonhans/sets/deep-33/. The unike-set name is here deep-33
so you wil write [mp3 sc="deep-33"]

Before you can use sets from soundcloud you will have to get an CLIENT_ID
You can register here http://developers.soundcloud.com/.  See the link "Register your app" and next "register new aplication". You
